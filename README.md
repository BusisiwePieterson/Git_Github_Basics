### What is Git ?

> Git is a widely used version control system for tracking changes in computer files. Version control is like a savings program for your project. By tracking and logging the changes you make to your file or file sets over time, a version-control system gives you the power to review or even restore earlier versions. Version control takes snapshots of every revision to your project. You can then access these versions to compare or restore them as needed.


### **Initializing a Git Repository**


`git init` : The command git init is used to create an empty Git repository.

`git add` : Add command is used after checking the status of the files, to add those untracked files to the staging area. The command is also used to add modified files. 

`git commit` : The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.
  - **-m** : allows you to write a commit message to describe the commit that you have made.

Checkout can also be used to create a new branch.

`git branch -d <branch_name` : This command is used to delete a branch.

## **Collaboration and Remote Repositories**

We now know that git is but how will developers working remotely work on the same code base? This is where Github comes in. GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.

Through GitHub, you can share your code with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various Git branches. This makes it possible for entire teams to work together on single projects in real-time. As changes are introduced, new branches are created, allowing the team to continue to revise the code without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
